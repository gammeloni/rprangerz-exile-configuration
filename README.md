# RPRangerZ Exile / Zombies / Mission setup
This is how we're keeping track of changes and adjustments to all mods on the RPRangerZ exile server.

# Server

## Server info
We're a community of (mostly) DayZ and Arma 3 players and run servers of each of these games. In DayZ, our focus lies on roleplaying. Our Arma server is currently PVE only until we have adapted it to our liking and open it to the public.

- **DayZ server** : 109.70.149.8:2500 "RPRangerZ (whitelisted) hosted by GamingDeluxe.co.uk "
- **Arma server** : 178.239.166.81:2302 "RPRangerZ Server | Exile (0.9.6.1) | Zs (4.6) | HVP (2.1) | Extended Base Mod (0.2.3) | Ai | Missions"

## Mods needed to join
- Exile
- Zombies and Demons
- Hollow's Vehicle Pack
- Extended Base Mod
Links to and infos about versions of the mods below in the server-side section.
The server currently runs on Altis, so you don't need AiA or CUP terrains and extra maps. This could be subject to change in the future though.
